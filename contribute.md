# How to help

## Some helpful tools to format and document

This repository builds on existing tools and extends funcionality according to user specific needs.
The basis for the tool box uses the [*neo*](https://github.com/NeuralEnsemble/python-neo) package and will incorporate functions from the [NWB](https://github.com/NeurodataWithoutBorders/pynwb) implementation in python.
Additionally, the tool box relies on analysis standards from literature and implementations of analysis and convenient functions from the [schmitzlab](https://github.com/Schmitz-lab).

When contributing code make sure to follow the style guidelines and check with code formatter *black* (can be istalled via `pip install black`)

```bash
$ black ephys/classes/class_functions.py 

All done! ✨ 🍰 ✨
1 file left unchanged.
```

To keep the code tidy and assure consistent standards please use *pylint* (can be installed via `pip install pylint`). By running *pylint* potential drop in quality can be detected and fixed before commiting code.

```bash
$ python -m pylint ephys/classes/class_functions.py
