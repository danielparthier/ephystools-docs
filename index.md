# EphysTools

Welcome to the documentation for [EphysTools](https://github.com/danielparthier/EphysTools), the tool box for *in-vitro* electrophysiology. This is a collaborative project to improve reproducibility and efficiency of analysis workflows for *in-vitro* electrophyiology.

## Philosophy

The goal is to simplify different workflows for analysis and documentation. At the same time these different processes should be combined to increase transparency and reduce the workload.
